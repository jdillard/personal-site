I recently read *[The Code Warrior's Way: Mental Training for Rock Climbers](http://warriorsway.com/the-rock-warriors-way-mental-training-for-climbers-2/)* and it helped me overcome some mental hurdles I was facing in climbing and in other areas of life. I thought it might be helpful for non-climbers so I'll try to briefly explain the concepts of rock climbing as they relate to the book so you can then better relate those concepts to your own life, even if you don't consider yourself a rock climber.

First off, I should probably explain what the draw of rock climbing is and why most climbers risk their bodies to get to the top of a rock in what appears the be the most difficult way possible. Rock climbing is essentially gamified problem solving where performance is based on mental and physical fitness. It has short term gains, typically referred to as projects, that involve getting up a particular route you have been working on. It also has long term gains in the form of bigger and harder projects.

As you might notice, at its base, a climbing career isn't a whole lot different than a technical career. It's a collection of small projects that, if done correctly, get larger and more difficult over time.
