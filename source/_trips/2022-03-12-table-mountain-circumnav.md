The weather and the avalanche forecast weren't stellar, but they were good
enough to give Corner Pocket a chance. We set a few decision points along the
way with the worst case goal of getting to explore new territory in the Baker
backcountry.

Finding the best place to cut through the trees from Artist Point to the South
side of Table can be tricky, try to aim high, but not too high. We decided to
drop in just on other side of the trees to get a few turns, but if you stay
high it is possible to ski traverse most of the way across.

The wind was coming in pretty strong out of the West, with the sun coming in
and out throughout the day. Koma Kulshan was showing off with whispy strands of
cirrus clouds waving off of its summit. As we got closer to Ptarmigan Pass we
were eyeing potential lines on [Video Peak](/trips/north-face-video-peak.html)
and making plans to return for it.

Corner Pocket was fantastic, we slowly and cautiously worked our way down,
continually looking for signs on wind loading.
