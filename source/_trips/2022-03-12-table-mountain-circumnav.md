The weather and the avalance forecast weren't stellar, but they were good enough to give it a chance. We set a few decision points along the way with the worst case goal of exploring new territory in the Baker backcountry.

Finding the best place to cut through the trees from Artist Point to the South side of Table can be tricky, aim high, but not too high. We ended up dropping in to get a few turns, but if you stay high it is possible to ski traverse most of the way across.

Super windy. Sun in and out a little. Baker showing off. As we got closer to Ptarmigan Pass we were eyeing potental lines on Video Peak and making plans to return for it.

Corner Pocket was fantastic, we slowly and cautiously worked our way down, continually looking for signs on wind loading.
