A few inches of fresh snow, with cold temps and fairly low wind.

## The Approach

Clouds kept a vail over Video Peak, like a bride on wedding day. The excitment
grew.

The conditions were so good we couldn't wait and dropped in on Ptarmigan Bowl.
The turns were amazing, better than expected, foreshadowing of a great day
ahead. 

Skinned up to the saddle, finding the most efficient route the rolling hills of
snow.

Once we got on the ridge, looking down towards 5830, Coleman Pinnacle, and Koma
Kulshan, filled your view with jagged curves.

We had plans to do 5830, but realized we were too amibitious.

Checked out the cornices we had noted below.

Michael talked me into doing the rock near the summit.

Ended up being excellent snow, dropped back down the skin track and both agreed we wanted to give it another go.

I dropped in first this time and dropped down the the pass.

Traverse the West side of Table Mountain, much easier this time.

Drop in on Alaskan Amber. Take some steep lines before cutting out far right
since there was barely any avy debris, a rare sight.
