I had run out here the previous August and it was hard not to notice the
inviting bowls that split off on each side of the summit and knew I had to come
back in the Winter.

## The Approach

This was the first hike approach I had done for a ski objective and while it
wasn't as enjoyable as skinning through snow covered trees, it was nice to be
able to gain elevation faster and more efficiently.

I was the only skiier that day and it was funny to pass people on a snowless
trail with a full ski setup on my back.

Once I got to the tree line the landscape was flat white as clouds rolled
through and the sun shined through in contrast.

The West Face provided a nice short first run.

The East face is where it's at and provieded a much longer 360 foot run.
