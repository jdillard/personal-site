Looks like the avy danger was upgraded to high in the morning, but forgot to check.

> **Note:** Remember to check the avy forecast in the morning.

Would have stayed in the trees more had we known that.

![Kendall Trees Approach](/assets/images/trips/kendall-knob-approach.jpg "Kendall Trees Approach"){: .shadow-5.oversized}{: loading="lazy"} <small><i>Working our way up through the Kendall trees.</i></small>

Ascend through trees. Discuss objectives for the day with another party. See skieer going through trees, looks fun.

![Kendall ski lines](/assets/images/trips/kendall-knob-ski-lines.jpg "Kendall ski lines"){: .shadow-5.oversized}{: loading="lazy"} <small><i>Ski lines above Kendall trees.</i></small>

Get to the tree line and see nice lines.

Went a little too high. Traverse over. Steepness is concearning, but doesn't look too bad. Gets worse the closer we get. Move fast and cautiously, spread out.

Get to other side and cut through some more trees.

Rip skins and decend down, getting a tiny huck. Get to __ Lakes.

Skin some more, too low angle of terrain.

See tracks up to the knob.

Get to the knob and rip skins.

![Kendall Knob descent](/assets/images/trips/kendall-knob-tree-descent.jpg "Kendall Knob descent"){: .shadow-5.oversized}{: loading="lazy"} <small><i>Descending off Kendall Knob through the trees.</i></small>

Descend down and get off course.

Go through tight trees on steep terrain. Not exactly fun, but skill building.

Get to the trail and follow it out.

The snow was reactive, but didn't see anything too spooky.
