In an attempt to mix things up, some friends and I decided to go on our first
sea kayaking adventure in the Salish Sea. We had all done our fair share of
other adventures before, but this was brand new territory and a chance to test
our abilities with the unknown.

## Itinerary

Our original plan was a 3 day trip that started on Lopez Island, used [Jones
Island State Park](https://parks.state.wa.us/525/Jones-Island) as a basecamp,
and ended back on Lopez Island.

## Day 1 - Arrive at Lopez Island

Since there were three of us, we decided to do one double touring kayak and one
single, with a total of five dry bags between us. We had recieved advice that we
wouldn't need a full wet suit, but according to [the 120&deg; Rule](https://www.gobair.org/Resources/Documents/Cold_Water.pdf)
and the conditions we encountered wearing at least a farmer john would have put
us in a more appropriate safety margin. Dry suits would have obviously been
ideal.

> matters. Between the water temperatures, speed of the currents, and weight of
> the kayaks, it isn't that hard for things to go sideways out there. The book

> tells many tales of strong kayakers that have died in those waters.

In what seemed like an eternity of fighting the tides and the wind, we finally
made it over to shore to gather ourselves. It turns out there is a small island
that shows up at low tide that Turn Rock Light sits on just off of Turn Island
that funnels the tide and causes the currents to be quite a bit faster. Another
dose of reality, having learned the hard way the limits of the tide charts we
had read online.

Luckily for us, we came across a mostly empty Turn Island Marine State Park and
were able to pick a prime camping spot right on the bay. We made sure to hang up
our food as we heard there is a ruthless gang of racoons on the island, who once
chewed through the hull of a kayak to get to some stowed food. We walked around
and saw starfish crawling on the rocks and later that night we were lucky enough
to be able to hear whales breaching off in the distance as they migrated down
the channel.

## Day 2 - Checking out Friday Harbor

Since we had planned on having running water avialable at our original campsite,
and Turn Island didn't provide that, we had to make a trek into Friday Harbor
the next day. We decided to wait until lunch time so we could grab a bite to eat
and try to hit the slack tide, but not so late that it was high tide while we 
were there and our potential landing areas would be underwater.

The closer to Friday Harbor we got the more overwhelming it was due to the
scattered boats of all sizes, ferries coming to and from the harbor, and
sea planes landing and taking off with tourists. We carefully made it into to
dock and were able to enjoy some fresh coffee and food before doing some
shopping for beer, cheese, and sausage -- oh, and water.

We got back to camp where we were greeted by a large group of kayakers that
turned out to be members of the Washington Kayak Club. They could tell we were
beginners and gave us a bunch of helpful sea kayaking tips that made us more
confident going forward.

## Day 3 - Return to Lopez Island

We woke up early to pack so that we could catch the slack tide back, which
worked out perfectly. Crossing the San Juan Channel when everything was
completely still and not a boat in sight was a totally different experience.
We saw dolphins in the distance and even had some curious seals cruising around
our kayaks and poking there little bald heads up to keep an eye on us.
