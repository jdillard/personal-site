In an attempt to mix things up, some friends and I decided to go on our first
sea kayaking adventure in the Salish Sea. We had all done our fair share of
other adventures before, but this was brand new territory and a chance to test
our abilities with the unknown.

## Itinerary

Since there were three of us, we decided to do one double touring kayak and one
single, with a total of five dry bags between us. We had recieved advice that we
wouldn't need a full wet suit, but according to [the 120&deg; Rule](https://www.gobair.org/Resources/Documents/Cold_Water.pdf)
and the conditions we encountered wearing at least a farmer john would have put
us in a more appropriate safety margin. Dry suits would have obviously been
ideal.

> to get first hand experience practicing rescue techniques before it really
> matters. Between the water temperatures, speed of the currents, and weight of
> the kayaks, it isn't that hard for things to go sideways out there. The book
> [Sea Kayaker's Deep Trouble](https://www.amazon.com/Sea-Kayakers-Deep-Trouble-Magazine/dp/0070084998)
> tells many tales of strong kayakers that have died in those waters.

Luckily for us, we came across a mostly empty Turn Island Marine State Park and
were able to pick a prime camping spot right on the bay. We made sure to hang up
our food as we heard there is a ruthless gang of racoons on the island, who once
chewed through the hull of a kayak to get to some stowed food. We walked around
and saw starfish crawling on the rocks and later that night we were lucky enough
to be able to hear whales breaching off in the distance as they migrated down
the channel.

Since we had planned on having running water avialable at our original campsite,
and Turn Island didn't provide that, we had to make a trek into Friday Harbor
the next day. We decided to wait until lunch time so we could grab a bite to eat
and try to hit the slack tide, but not so late that it was high tide while we 
were there and our potential landing areas would be underwater.

We got back to camp where we were greeted by a large group of kayakers that
turned out to be members of the Washington Kayak Club. They could tell we were
beginners and gave us a bunch of helpful sea kayaking tips that made us more
confident going forward.
