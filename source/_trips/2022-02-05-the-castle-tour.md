## The Approach

Since there were three of us, we decided to do one double touring kayak and one
single, with a total of five dry bags between us. We had recieved advice that we
wouldn't need a full wet suit, but according to [the 120&deg; Rule](https://www.gobair.org/Resources/Documents/Cold_Water.pdf)
and the conditions we encountered wearing at least a farmer john would have put
us in a more appropriate safety margin. Dry suits would have obviously been
ideal.

Since we had planned on having running water avialable at our original campsite,
and Turn Island didn't provide that, we had to make a trek into Friday Harbor
the next day. We decided to wait until lunch time so we could grab a bite to eat
and try to hit the slack tide, but not so late that it was high tide while we 
were there and our potential landing areas would be underwater.

The closer to Friday Harbor we got the more overwhelming it was due to the
scattered boats of all sizes, ferries coming to and from the harbor, and
sea planes landing and taking off with tourists. We carefully made it into to
dock and were able to enjoy some fresh coffee and food before doing some
shopping for beer, cheese, and sausage -- oh, and water.

We got back to camp where we were greeted by a large group of kayakers that
turned out to be members of the Washington Kayak Club. They could tell we were
beginners and gave us a bunch of helpful sea kayaking tips that made us more
confident going forward.

## Ripping the South Slope

We woke up early to pack so that we could catch the slack tide back, which
worked out perfectly. Crossing the San Juan Channel when everything was
completely still and not a boat in sight was a totally different experience.
We saw dolphins in the distance and even had some curious seals cruising around
our kayaks and poking there little bald heads up to keep an eye on us.

Summary of decent.
