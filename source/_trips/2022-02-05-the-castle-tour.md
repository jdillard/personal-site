We met that morning at [Whittaker's Bunkhouse](https://goo.gl/maps/gKPFG59oSuxBbYRK9)
for a second round of coffee and breakfast, then left in time to get to the
gate to Paradise at Longmire right before 9am, parking at the
[Narada Falls parking lot](https://goo.gl/maps/86cbrbDi7zrgz1Ap8).

## The Approach

We walked past the bathrooms to the end of the short service road and started
boot packing up to Stevens Canyon Road. We followed the scenic flat road until
we got to Reflection Lakes, then cut right to start skinning through the trees
towards The Castle.

We worked our way through the trees until we got to the tree line just above
5,600ft, making for about 700ft of gain since leaving the road. The timing put
sun just coming over the ridge line, offering an ominous silhouette of The
Castle in what remained of the low hanging clouds.

For most of the way you can turn around and get glimpses of Mount Rainier
behind you, with more an more becoming visible as you gain elevation. Since,
it was my first time in the Tatoosh, is was great getting a summary of the
terrain. We also talked about future objectives, such as the [Nisqually Bridge
Run](/trips/nisqually-bridge-run.html) and Paradise Glacier, as we ran our
pointed fingers all over the mountain.

While the final push above tree line, another 600ft of gain, was a little technical with the iced up
snow, you couldn't help but stare into the sun as it rose out of the belly of
the saddle.

## Skiing the South Slope

Once we got eyes on the South face we knew we had to give it a go, but given
that it was South facing we wanted to get a closer look before making the final
decision. Since it was still early the day, we made our way up to the base of
the rock and ripped skins. The snow was nice an buttery as we dropped all the
way down, before cutting over and skinning back up to the ridge.

## The Descent

We skied our way down the tree line where I started to notice my binding was
loose, realizing no on the team had any repair tools (I now have a repair
kit), but luckily a pair of girls stopped and let me borrow their Leatherman Signal
with the bit extension to adjust my binding back to the correct length.

Besides that, everything went smooth through the trees, just make sure you don't
end up in a terrain trap as the terrain is very variable through that section.
We got a last set of turns on the hill down to the service road and it ended up
being a dreamy way to end the day.
