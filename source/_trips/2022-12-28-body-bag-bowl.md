Decided to go checkout the Blackcomb Backcountry for some early season skiing during the holiday break.
It was our first time.
Checked the lift and gate status for the [Backcountry Uphill Access Routes](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/the-mountain/mountain-conditions/terrain-and-lift-status.aspx) and went with **Option 6** on the [Whistler Blackcomb Backcountry](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/the-mountain/about-the-mountain/backcountry.aspx) website.
It's pretty typical for the high alpine to be closed with access to the Blackcomb backcountry limited to the **Lower Cloud 9** gate.

The weather wasn't cooperating with wild temperature fluctuations a few days prior so the avalanche conditions on the [Avalanche Canada Map](https://www.avalanche.ca/map) were touch and go.

## The Approach

We ride the Blackcomb Gondola up and take the Expressway down to the bottom of 7th Heaven and wait in line to possibly take it up so we can get a run in as we traverse over for a slightly higher entry point.
After thirty minutes of waiting past the projected start time for the lift we decide to just start skinning and save the option to take the lift later in the day if we needed.

Once we got out of the trees and got a look of Blackcomb and Disease Ridge and it looked a lot more bony than we had naively expected.

We continued working our way up the ridge, stopping at the first rock band and deciding to drop in an test the snow out. Which was deeper than expected with no obvious signs of reaction in that section.

We saw two parties go through the mousetrap towards the Decker-Disease Ridge col so we decided to follow as that was one of the potential tours we had planned for the day.

We caught up to one of the parties at the col and transitioned before dropping down to Circle Lake for a fun little ski.
The sun came out for a short bit lightening the mood for the day.

After a quick snack break we started working our way up to the East Col.
