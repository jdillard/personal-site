Upon discovering there was a nearby lake that not only contained several
species of native and non-native carnivorous plants, one being the ever popular
venus flytrap, but also a floating log island, I knew I had to figure out a
way to see it first hand.

We took my inflatable pack raft and three piece Easy Rider kayak carefully down
to the water as the bog has a sensative border of soil floating on water.

## Various Carnivorous Plants

Along the edges of the bog we were able to find common sundew as well as yellow
and purple pitcher plants.

The yellow pitcher plants were most prolific and are propegating more each
year.

It was a little late in the season to see the Sarracenia Purpurea, purple pitcher plant, in it's full glory, but it still made a great showing. The nearest native populations are in Southern Alberta.

Unfortunately, the venus flytraps remained elusive. Perhaps we were too late in
the season or perhaps they finally perished, being as they come from quite a
different climate in the Carolinas and Florida region.

## Log Island

Much prior to that, as the local lore goes, it had been owned by a pre-eminent
bootlegger of high quality whiskey who crafted a log platform with a mechanism
to unload logs from the nearby railcars and transport them to the mill located
on the lake (as mills were steam fed and the lake water could also be used to
store the logs, keeping them from drying out).

Over time the log platform filled with dirt, salal plants, and eventually
trees. The small trees deemed unsatisfactory by the local beaver population now
serve as a sail for the man-made island as it travels back and forth across the
lake with the changing directions of the wind.
