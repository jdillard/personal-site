We met that morning at [Whittaker's Cafe](https://whittakersbunkhouse.com/cafe/)
for a second round of coffee and breakfast, then left in time to get to the
gate to Paradise at Longmire right before 9am, parking at the
[Paradise parking lot](https://goo.gl/maps/AqXDswqnQBE8PTPC6).

Our plan that morning was to try for Nisqually Chute if the conditions allowed
for it, something we weren't confident about that day, with a back up plan of
trying out Paradise Glacier.

This option is mentioned in [Backcountry Ski & Snowboard Routes
Washington](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/backcountry-ski--snowboard-routes-washington/9172445/)
as a descent option for Camp Muir, described as _"The often overlooked slopes of
Paradise Glacier can offer excellent skiing"_. And after skiing it, we would
have to agree.

## The Approach

![Mt Rainier Approach](/assets/images/trips/paradise-glacier-approach.jpg "Mt Rainier approach"){: .shadow-5.oversized}{: loading="lazy"} <small><i>Mt. Rainier approach, heading towards Panorama Point.</i></small>

The parking lot was average for a winter weekend and the sun loomed overhead,
reminding us of the head start it got on us. We started moving fairly quickly
across the frozen snow.

Panorama Point was icy, so all but one of us booted up it.

The weather was colder and windier than we expected, and cloud cover was
starting to move in earlier than we expected.

Nisqually Chute looks less intemidating the closer we get.

Decide not to go all the way to Anvil rock since the wind is howling and the
weather was only getting worse.

Drop down to Paradise Glacier.

Work our way over icy wind scouled snow.

![Descending Paradise Glacier](/assets/images/trips/paradise-glacier-descent.jpg "Descending Paradise Glacier"){: .shadow-5.oversized}{: loading="lazy"}<small><i>Descending Paradise Glacier.</i></small>

Lots of avy debris to dodge, but totally doable.

Decide to traverse high on the left side.

Rest and regroup. Drops iPhone.

Continue working down, cross the  creek.

Steep section was fun.

Aim for the trees.

Tree skiing was a blast.

Work our way up the road back to the parking lot.
