We met that morning at [Whittaker's Cafe](https://whittakersbunkhouse.com/cafe/)
for a second round of coffee and breakfast, then left in time to get to the
gate to Paradise at Longmire right before 9am, parking at the
[Paradise parking lot](https://goo.gl/maps/AqXDswqnQBE8PTPC6).

Originally trying for Nisqually Chute, via Anvil rock.

Panorama Point was icy, boot up it.

Colder and windier than we expect.

Nisqually Chute looks less intemidating the closer we get.

Decide not to go all the way to Anvil rock since the wind is howling and the
weather is only getting worse.

Drop down to Paradise Glacier. Turns out this descent is mentioned in
[Backcountry Ski & Snowboard Routes
Washington](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/backcountry-ski--snowboard-routes-washington/9172445/)
for a descent option of Camp Muir as _"The often overlooked slopes of Paradise
Glacier can offer excellent skiing"_.

Work our way over icy wind scouled snow.

Lots of avy debris to dodge, but totally doable.

Decide to traverse high on the left side.

Rest and regroup. Drops iPhone.

Continue working down, cross the  creek.

Steep section was fun.

Aim for the trees.

Tree skiing was a blast.

Work our way up the road back to the parking lot.
