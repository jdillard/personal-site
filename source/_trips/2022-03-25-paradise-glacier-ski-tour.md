We met that morning at [Whittaker's Cafe](https://whittakersbunkhouse.com/cafe/)
for a second round of coffee and breakfast, then left in time to get to the
gate to Paradise at Longmire right before 9am, parking at the
[Paradise parking lot](https://goo.gl/maps/AqXDswqnQBE8PTPC6).

Our plan that morning was to try for Nisqually Chute if the conditions allowed
for it, something we weren't confident about that day, with a back up plan of
trying out Paradise Glacier.

Paradise Glacier is mentioned in [Backcountry Ski & Snowboard Routes
Washington](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/backcountry-ski--snowboard-routes-washington/9172445/)
as a descent option for Camp Muir, described as _"The often overlooked slopes of
Paradise Glacier can offer excellent skiing"_. After skiing it, we would
have to agree.

## The Approach

The parking lot was average for a winter weekend and the sun loomed overhead,
reminding us of the head start it got on us. We quickly got ready and started
moving across the frozen snow.

Panorama Point was icy, so all but one of us in the initial push of people
decided to boot up it.

The weather stayed colder and windier than we expected as we moved further and
further up, and the cloud cover was starting to move in earlier than we expected.

[Nisqually Chute](/trips/nisqually-bridge-run.html) looked less intimidating
the closer we got, a welcome relief for me.

We decided not to go all the way to Anvil rock since the wind is howling, the
snow never softened, and the weather was only getting worse.

Instead we stopped on the ridge for a quick rest while we transitioned and
discussed if we were going with plan A or B.  It didn't take long to decide to
drop down to Paradise Glacier, so the conversation moved to route finding
logistics to make sure we had a safe exit.

We started by having to Work our way over icy wind scoured snow. Luckily the
snow pack was high this time of year, so crevasses weren't much of a concern.
Once we got down in to the valley, there were lots of recent avalanche debris to
dodge, but totally manageable.

To do so, we traversed high on the left side, saving up enough gravity to get
us through the second half.  After a quick rest we continue working our way
down, gaining some speed to cross the creek and gain a small knob.

The back side of the knob had a short steep section that was a lot of fun.  We
then aimed for the trees, having a blast casually cruising down through them
and enjoying the sheltered conditions down low.

Once we hit the road we followed it our way up back to the parking lot.
