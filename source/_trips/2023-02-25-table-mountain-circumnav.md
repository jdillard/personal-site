- Snow conditions

I decided to go clockwise as I prefer to traverse below the South side of Table in the morning vs the afternoon.
It also has more open slope skiing vs treed skiing. So pick your poison.

I got up to Artist Point just as a team was topping out on Table Mountain.
I decided to tag Huntoon Point to get a better view on Lake Ann. A fun little side mission that only added about 30 minutes to the tour.

Saw people braving the winds on video peak but never saw them drop. I'm not sure if they went down the Northeast Face or decided to bail based on the conditions, but the snow on the North Face, tale tell signs of snow drift. 
I noticed the water I keep on my backpack strap was starting to freeze, so I chugged what was left. I ended up with 100ml of ice.
Ptarmigan Bowl to Kootenay Trees. Hush Hush can be wind effected, so don't be tempted to cut the corner at the saddle unless you're familiar with the terrain.

Careful dropping down the trees on Bonsai Trees as there can be an open creek that is hard to see.
Breaking out of the trees and seeing the prow above Pond Shop.

Getting more angles on Lasiocarpa.

![Iceberg Lake](/assets/images/trips/2023-02-25-table-mountain-circumnav/iceberg-lake.jpg "Iceberg Lake"){: .shadow-5.oversized}{: loading="lazy"} <small><i>Lunch break on Iceberg Lake.</i></small>

As I crossed Iceberg Lake a wispy snow devil wandered it's way towards me before breaking up, like a clumsy cougar cub learning to pounce.
As I got to Herman saddle, the visibility was starting to deteriorate as the next storm slowly rolled in.
