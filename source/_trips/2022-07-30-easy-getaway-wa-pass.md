Met at Cutthroat Trailhead and I got there, a little later than I originally
planned, to a sky full of stars and a fairly prominent Milky Way.

Not only did I manage to forget my sleeping bag, but I also didn't think about
preparing for a cold start in the morning. Which lead to a lack of motivation
for the alpine start we had planned on doing.

## Approach

The approach started off easy enough, a little light bushwacking on a mostly
open trail. Then it turns left into steeper terrain, but for the most part you
can follow open areas all the way to the top, with only small patches of dense
alger.

The approach eventually changes to mostly skree and small talus, but if you
play your cards right, you can keep that to a minimum. The downloadable GPX on
Mountain Project was a great help and likely saved a ton of time and effort.

The platform is pretty obvious. Look for streaked block.

## Climb

Finding the platform start was easy enough.

### First pitch

Up the right facing crack. The slab section was tricky to protect, so just
ended up launching through it.

Pulled the overlap and headed left to setup an anchor near the base of the next
right facing corner.

### Second Pitch

This one was dirty with a crappy fall zone, otherwise it would be a nice pitch.

### Third Pitch

Follow the thin ledge to underneath the larger overhang.

### Forth Pitch

A heady pitch compared to the previous ones. Make sure to go all the way to the
tree as the next pitch is wondery.

### Fifth Pitch

The right variation is fairly straight forward if you don't overthink the
traverse. Stay low and work your way to the crack system on the right.

### Sixth Pitch

The chiminey is short and fairly secure. Keep the gear you want to use on your right side.

Drop a loop from the first tree to the right of the crack to grab the bags.
Fairly easy climbing to finish, we ended up just using a hip belay.

## Descent

We found sun damaged slings wrapped around a large boulder on the right.
Given their condention we decided to back them up with an additional slings.

We rapped to a tree below with more sun damaged slings that we backed up, then
to the ground.

From there we crossed the gulley and started the traverse up a grassy ramp. I
would try to resist the urge to descend from countouring too early, as you'll
have to go through loose skree vs slightly more pleasant meadows.

Bring a water filter as there is a possible water refill here, or you can wait
until further down the descent where the creek gets a little larger.

Maybe it's because it was a hot day, but this descent was worse than expected.
It isn't too difficult to find the stage again if you left bags, and there
isn't much additional elevation distance to do so.

Finding the optimal line on the way down proved to be more difficult, as we
ended up charging through thick sections of brush versus taking the time to
find a path that may or may not have ended up being a dead end. Bigger creek to
dip feet in down low.

## Thoughts

All told, it was a nice adventure climb, it just would have been more enjoyable
had we planned it being such an adventure. The fact it is Northish facing,
gives you time to get most or all of the route done before the sun hits if you
get an early start.
