In order to get an adventure climb in for the season, Michael and I decided to
try out [Easy Getaway](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/115311402/easy-getaway),
an under visited climb with no established trail. I got to
[Cutthroat Trailhead](https://goo.gl/maps/E6wd9oj7Qe4ipGFH6) a little later than
I originally planned, to a sky full of stars and a fairly prominent Milky Way.

Not only did I manage to forget my sleeping bag, but I also didn't think about
preparing for a cold start in the morning. Which lead to a lack of motivation
for the alpine start we had originally planned on doing.

## Approach

The late approach started off easy enough, with a little light bushwhacking on a mostly
open trail, before it turns left into steeper terrain. If you pick your path wisely, you
can follow open areas all the way to the top, with only small patches of dense
alder.

The approach eventually changes to mostly scree and small talus, but if you
play your cards right, you can keep that to a minimum. The downloadable GPX on
[Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/map/113436052/cutthroat-wall)
was a great help and likely saved a ton of time and effort.

The platform where the first pitch starts is pretty obvious. Make sure to look
up for the streaked block that is on the fifth pitch to give yourself some general
direction.

## Climb

Finding the platform start was easy enough.

### First pitch

The first pitch starts up the right facing crack. The middle slab section was
tricky to protect, so I ended up just launching through the crux move. After
that, pull the overlap and head left to setup an anchor near the base of the
next right facing corner.

### Second Pitch

This pitch was fairly dirty with a crappy fall zone, otherwise it is nice.

### Third Pitch

After pulling the short corner, head left and make sure to follow the thin
separated ledge until you're underneath the larger overhang.

### Forth Pitch

A heady pitch compared to the previous ones. Try to finish all the way up at
the tree, as the next pitch is wondery.

### Fifth Pitch

The right variation is fairly straight forward if you don't overthink the
traverse. Stay low and work your way over to the base of the crack system on
the right.

### Sixth Pitch

The chimney is short and fairly secure. I went right shoulder in and kept the
gear I wanted to use on my left side. Enjoy the view as you try to work your
helmet past the constriction.

To make it easier on the follower, drop a loop from the first tree over the
right of the crack to grab the bags. From there it's fairly easy climbing to 
finish, we ended up just using a hip belay.

## Descent

We found sun damaged slings wrapped around a large boulder on the right.  Given
their condition we decided to back them up with an additional slings. Bringing
rappel gear on adventure climbs is good rule in general.

We rapped to a tree below with more sun damaged slings that we backed up, then
to the ground.

From there we crossed the gully and started the traverse up a grassy ramp then
started to contour towards the next gully system.

Maybe it's because it was a hot day, but this descent was worse than expected.
It isn't too difficult to find the starting platform again if you left bags, and there
isn't much additional elevation to gain to do so.

Finding the optimal line on the way down proved to be more difficult, as we
ended up charging through thick sections of brush versus taking the time to
find a path that may or may not have ended up being a dead end.

![Easy Getaway Creek](/assets/images/trips/easy-getaway-creek.jpg "Easy Getaway Creek"){: .shadow-5.oversized}{: loading="lazy"} <small><i>A much needed reprieve at the creek.</i></small>

The creek gets big enough to dip your feet in down low and makes for a nice
reprieve before the last push out.

## Thoughts

All told, it was a nice adventure climb, it just would have been more enjoyable
had we planned on it being such an adventure. The fact it is Northish facing,
gives you time to get most or all of the route done before the sun hits if you
get an early start.
