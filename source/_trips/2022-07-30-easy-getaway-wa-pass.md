Met at Cutthroat Trailhead.
Loud neighbors.
Full sky of stars.
Forgot Sleeping bag.
Late start.
Not enough food/water.

## Approach

Started off easy enough.
A little light bushwacking on a mostly open trail.

Cut left and up and the steep bushwacking starts, small taste.
Opens up and flattens out, optimism builds.
Eventually changes to mostly skree and small talus, but play your cards right and you can keep that to a minimum.
Use GPX.
The stage is pretty obvious.
Look for streaked block.

## Climb

### First pitch.

Find start.

Tricky to protect, but best to just launch through.

### Second Pitch.

Dirty with a crappy fall zone.

Third Pitch.
Follow the ledge to the larger overhang.

Forth Pitch.
Heady pitch.
Make sure to go all the way to the tree as the next pitch is wondery.

Fifth Pitch.
Right variation is fairly straight forward if you don't overthink the traverse.

Sixth Pitch.
Offwidth is short and fairly secure.
Keep the gear you want to use on your right side.
Drop loop to grab bags from first tree.
Fairly easy climbing to finish, could be hip belayed.

## Descent

We found slings on the right around a large boulder.
Backup the slings. They looked sun damaged so we added another strand.
Rapped to tree, then to ground.

Cross gulley.
Traverse.
Descend skree if you descend too early.
Possible water refill.
Crappy descent.
Find the stage again if you left bags (not much of a difference).

More crappy decent.
Bigger creek to dip feet in down low.

## Thoughts

It was a nice adventure climb.
It was dirty.
The descent sucks.
Northish facing.
