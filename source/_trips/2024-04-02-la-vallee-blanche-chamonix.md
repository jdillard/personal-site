After several stormy days, leading to 150km winds in the valley, the storm slowed bringing cold snow and calmer winds.

Pierre asks if we have powder skis

We went to get a burrito across from the Augille du Midi.

Meet Pierre and he says there is a chance the conditions aren't good enough. We overhear a couple of guys from SLC talking to their guide and it turns out they had already had to reschedule once and this was the last chance they had. It appeared they wanted a high chance of success and the guide wasn't willing to provide that and backed out.

We decide to wait it out. The first gondola was delayed while they cleared the lines from ice and we wouldn't know for sure until we got up there to get eyes on things.

Besides the quality of the snow, due to unknown winds, the main risk with the conditions was visibility. Even though the French side was sunny, the Italian side often stayed foggier.

The load thed first cable car and it is absolutely packed. At the mid station the workers unload equipment from the other car before we can load it and give a Hollar as the doors close. The stoke rippled through the car.

Pierre gives us a tour of the Midi, possibly buying time for others to go first. We put on our crampons and prepare to walk the ridge, carrying our packs horizontally to get through the tight tunnels to the exit.

We rope up and michael goes first plunging waist deep into the softest snow we've ever experienced (la peuf). Plunge stepping down the ridge in unison we reached a fairly flat spot in a saddle.

We put on our skis and float. The guide trying to not be impatient.

Due to low visibility, we decide to hug the rock to keep a reference point. Rolling down hills of powder trying to keep up with the guide.

Stopping for the occasional picture, soaking in the sweeping terrain and to allow our legs to catch their breath.

Pierre's persistence payed off as we stayed towards the front of the pack, sometimes taking lead.

We navigated the glacier field with ease before ending up in the flat section and a quick break to eat in the sun and take more videos.

At one point Pierre asks if we have wives or girlfriends and we say no, not sure what he is getting at. Then follows by saying that sometimes when you get this lucky with the snow you have to wonder if your partner is getting lucky too.

We essentially cross country ski for what feels like a mile before hitting the hard pack, shark infested finish.

At the end the guides talked amongst themselves how it was the best day of the season and up there in comparison to other seasons.

All pack in the train and head down to grab a beer.

> **Note:** Since _Franz's Chair_ is supposedly only open when the alpine lifts are closed, it is worth researching if there is ever a short window where it is possible to do both _Franz's Chair_ after it opens and all the alpine lifts, including _Glacier T-bar_, before they close.
> Thus making is possible to get all 23 lifts.
