We arrived in Chamonix and just happened to miss several stormy days, including 150km winds through the valley. When the storm finally slowed, it brought cold snow up high with calmer winds the night before we were to do La Valee Blanche.

Since it was our first time in Chamonix, we decided to hire a guide, Pierre, through [Compagnie des guides de Chamonix](www.chamonix-guides.com) who called the day before to align things up. He asked if we had powder skis, partly to make sure we were prepared for the conditions, but mostly with a tone that hinted he was hoping to get after it the next day.

We met Pierre at the base of the Aguille du Midi cable cars the morning of and he explained there is a chance the conditions aren't safe enough due to the amount of snow/wind and lack of visibility, but we wouldn't know until we got up there. Even though the French side was sunny, the Italian side often stayed foggier.

While we waited for the them to clear the cable car lines from ice, we overhear a couple of guys from Salt Lake City talking to their guide and it turns out they had already had to reschedule doing La Valee Blanche once and this was the last chance they had at doing it before returning to the States. After some deliberation, it appeared they wanted too high chance of success and the guide wasn't willing to provide that and backed out and they all went their seperate ways.

The lines finally get cleared and they load the first cable car and it is absolutely packed. At the mid station, workers were unloading equipment from the other cable car that came from the top while everyone tried to glean what the conditions might be from their faces. After we shuffled over, they gave a loud "Yew!" right as the doors were closing and a wave of stoke rippled throughout the car.

Once at the top, Pierre gave us a tour of the Midi, possibly buying time for others to go first and suss out the conditions. After a quick bathroom break, we put on our crampons and prepare to walk the snowy ridge, carrying our packs horizontally to get through the tightly constructed tunnels towards the exit.

We rope up outside, reality starting to sink in, and Michael goes first plunging waist deep into the softest powder, _la peuf_, we've ever experienced. Once we reached a fairly flat spot in a saddle we put on our skis and floated down the first decent.

Due to low visibility, we decide to hug the rock to keep a reference point. Rolling down hills of powder trying to keep up with the guide.

Stopping for the occasional picture, soaking in the sweeping terrain and to allow our legs to catch their breath.

Pierre's persistence payed off as we stayed towards the front of the pack, sometimes taking lead.

We navigated the glacier field with ease before ending up in the flat section and a quick break to eat in the sun and take more videos.

At one point Pierre asks if we have wives or girlfriends and we say no, not sure what he is getting at. Then follows by saying that sometimes when you get this lucky with the snow you have to wonder if your partner is getting lucky too.

We essentially cross country ski for what feels like a mile before hitting the hard pack, shark infested finish.

At the end the guides talked amongst themselves how it was the best day of the season and up there in comparison to other seasons.

All pack in the train and head down to grab a beer.
