I went up to Whistler with James after he had recently made an (almost) succesful attempt at doing every running lift at Vail in a day, accidently missing only one beginner chair, and he thought we could do the same thing at Whistler Blackcomb.

Some considerations we took were:

- The lift's open and close times.
- Typical lift line locations in the morning versus afternoon.
- Waiting until after the time change so the lifts run longer.
- The chance of alpine closures due to current conditions.
  - Note that the _Glacier T-bar_ doesn't run as often, partly due to the receding glacier, and that _Franz's Chair_ is typically only ran when the alpine is closed, in order to help reduce the lift demand.
- Weekdays and non-optimal conditions are going to provide shorter lines.

> **Note:** Since _Franz's Chair_ is supposedly only open when the alpine lifts are closed, it is worth researching if there is ever a short window where it is possible to do both the alpine lifts, including _Glacier T-bar_, before they close and _Franz's Chair_ after it opens.
> Thus making is possible to get all 23 lifts.

## Whistler Mountain

We were able to start loading at 8:15am on the _Fritz Simmons Express_ **[1]** then right to _Garbanzo Express_ **[2]**, before the short ski down to _Emerald Express_ via **Lower Whiskey Jack** _(green)_.

Next, we took _Emerald Express_ **[3]** up, and after reading the lift status, realized we made a mistake and that _Peak Express_ wasn't going to run until 9:30am, in another 40 minutes.
We were hoping to earn "style points" by working in the longest runs, from top to bottom, on both the Whistler and Blackcomb sides, so we gave up on the Whistler side to ensure we had enough time.
In hindsight, we could have done _Olympic Chair_ and _Whistler Village Gondola_ next giving _Peak Express_ time to open, thus being able to do the **Peak to Creek**.

From there, we skied down via **Lower Pony Trail** _(green)_ to **Little Red Run** _(blue)_ to **Upper Franz's** _(blue)_ to **Highway 86** _(blue)_ to **Upper Pony Trail** _(green)_ to **Upper Expressway** _(green)_ to **Fallaway Bypass** _(green)_ to **Lower Dave Murray Downhill** _(black)_.
Given the Spring like conditions, the lower down we got the icier the conditions were, making it clear we were operating on principle instead of logic.

From the base, we took _Creekside Gondola_ **[4]** then continued up via _Big Red Express_ **[5]**, and on the ride learned that the Blackcomb Gondola had shut down the day before due to a failure and was under maintenance this morning.
We decided to save that one for the end to ensure it had time to get fixed and continued on by taking the short connector to _Peak Express_.

From _Peak Express_ **[6]**, we took **Matthews' Traverse** _(green)_ to **The Saddle** _(black)_.

Bringing us back to the _Whistler T-bar_ **[7]** so that we could ski down via **Pika's Traverse** _(green)_ to **Harmony Piste** (blue) to **G.S.** _(blue)_.

From there, we took the _Harmony Chairlift_ **[8]**, and skied down via **Upper Burnt Stew Trail** _(green)_ to **Jeff's Ode to Joy** _(blue)_ to **Adiago** _(blue)_.

Followed by the _Symphony Express_ **[9]**, and skiing down via **Jeff's Ode to Joy** _(blue)_ to **Burnt Stew Trail** _(green)_ to **Harmony Ridge** _(blue)_ to **Sidewinder** (green) to **Upper Olympic** _(green)_ to **Upper Fantastic** _(green)_.
Upper Fantastic is a beginner area so we took it slow and I did some carving drills to fit in.

Which lead us to the _Olympic Chair_ **[10]**, a slow fixed chair for beginners, before we skied down via **It Happens** _(green)_ to **Lower Olympic** _(green)_ to **Lower Fantastic** _(blue)_ and back on to **Lower Olympic** _(green)_.

To finish off the Whistler side, we took the _Whistler Village Gondola_ **[11]** and decided we were making such good time that we would take the time to stop and get a burger at Roundhouse for some extra "style points".

## Blackcomb Montain

Once we finished, we took _Peak 2 Peak Gondola_ **[12]** over to the Blackcomb side and skied down **Wishbone** _(blue)_ to **Jersey Cream** (blue).

Then took _Glacier Express_ **[13]** to ski down via **Upper Ridge Runner** _(blue)_ to **Rock & Roll** _(blue)_ to **Backstage Pass** _(blue)_ to **Blackcomb Glacier Road** _(blue)_.

Working over to _Crystal Ridge Express_ **[14]**, so we could Ski down via **Lower Ridge Runner** _(blue)_  to **Blackcomb Glacier Road** _(blue)_.

And take the _Excelerator Express_ **[15]**, with a short ski down **Wishbone** _(blue)_.

Then up _Jersey Cream Express_ **[16]** to ski down **Catskinner** _(black)_ to **Upper Easy Out** _(green)_.

And _Catskinner Express_ **[17]** with a ski across **Expressway** _(green)_ towards _7th Heaven Express_.

While in line for _7th Heaven Express_ **[18]**, we decided to get a bonus ski run down **Everglades** _(black)_ through the trees back down to 7th Heaven, ideally we would have timed this run a little earlier as the snow had started turning to mashed potatoes.
We waited in line about 20 minutes, as they had to skip loading every forth chair due to the engines overheating, which ended up being our only real wait of the day.
After we took _7th Heaven Express_ the second time, we skied down via **Upper Greenline** _(green)_ to **Upper Springboard** (blue) to **Stoker** _(blue)_ to **Grub Stake** _(blue)_ to Greenline (green) to **Village Run** _(green)_.

We then rode _Excalibur Gondola_ **[19]** and skied down **Green line** _(green)_ to **Yellow Brick Road** _(green)_.

After a "quick" ride on _Magic Chair_ **[20]**, another slow fixed lift for beginners, we skied down **Merlin's** _(blue)_.

Bringing us to the final lift, the _Blackcomb Gondola_ **[21]**.
We stopped for a victory hot chocolate at the top before finishing by skiing down Upper Honeycomb (blue) to **Grub Stake** _(blue)_ to **Greenline** _(green)_ to **Village Run** _(green)_.

## Conclusion

All in all, it was the perfect activity for a weekday and we likely would have had to ride groomers most of the day reguardless.
We learned that there is no need to rush, as long as you just stay moving.
I'd be interested to see what approaches other people take and what "style points" they can come up with.
