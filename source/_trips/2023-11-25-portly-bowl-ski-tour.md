Washington received an atmospheric river in late October that stretched all the way to Washington Pass, where by then it had cooled into a healthy dose of snow.
Since not much of a base had formed yet, there wasn't much avalanche danger and therefore the pass remained open.

I had wanted to explore the Cutthroat Peak area area in winter, especially after climbing the [South Buttress](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/109326651/south-buttress) that summer, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity.
Since avalanche forecasts weren't being performed yet, we wanted to play it conservative and this also seemed like a safe line.

On the way out that morning we saw a few car's worth of people at Rainy pass, but no one was parked at Cutthroat, we had the whole place to ourselves.
