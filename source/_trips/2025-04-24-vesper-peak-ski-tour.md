I slept near the trailhead, they met me in the morning.

We leave trailhead at 8:30am and it turns out to be a casual hike and creek crossing until we reach Wertz basin where the snow starts.

We decided to keep our runners on until it got too bad as snow was stiffer than we expected, good sign for later.

Luckily, a team of 6 mountaineers in crampons was ahead of us setting a boot pack, which made things much easier get up Headlee pass.

We took one coulior to the right of the summer route, since it was wider and the snow was better.

We caught up to the mountaineers at the top and caught our breath. Then worked down through the trees back to the main path, a very short and easy section.

From there it was back on the summer route as we headed to where the lake drains and we switched from soaking wet runners into skinning.

Skinned up was fairly chill, a lot of side hilling, but only a couple steep sections. The spring views are incredible.

We eventually passed the mountaineers again about half way up Vesper, which was smooth sailing with a slightly steeper section for the summit block.

We reached the summit at about the same time the mountaineers did and enjoyed the views.

The ski back down was quick as we returned back to Headlee pass without having to transition. From there went down the pass one at a time, as lots of wet loose was sluffing off.

After that, we skied out the avy debris, putting back on our partially dried out runners at the edge of Wertz basin. We hiked out hitting my skis on what seemed like every rock I stepped down off of.
