I slept in Mazama at the [Goat Creek
Sno-Park](https://goo.gl/maps/1fcmUByfYYyAq2uY6) and Michael stopped before the
pass to sleep since he had to come up from Seattle after work. On his way to
meet me at the amazing [Mazama Store](https://www.themazamastore.com/) he
noticed there wasn't much parking dug out this year and most of it was already
full.

We parked east of hairpin and geared up, taking in the scenery.

We decided to see how far we could get walking up through the trees until plunge stepping got too annoying. It wasn't long before we switched to skinning, only a slightly better option. Not long after that ski crampons were necessary to make it up the smooth frozen surface.

We reached the debris field with a clear view of the goal.

We took a quick snack break and switched to using boot crampons so we could boot up the couloir.

Which turned into an exercise of finding snow with the right amount of sun exposure, not too soft, not too frozen. After what felt like an eternaty, we reached the soft skree finish at the top.

It was decent ski down east side, with better corn on next section as we started to traverse South on the back side of Kangaroo.

We start to notice cornices on just about every col we could use to cross back over, and discuss our options.

We decide to traverse as far as we can before it becomes too comitting, that way we could see all the options and choose what we thought was safest.

We pick one without any cornices, but as we get closer we notice a large cornice hanging from rocks on the North side of the col.

We make sure to avoid it's path as we transition from skinning to booting, while doing so a hidden one crashes down 50ft to our left.

We speed up and quickly boot up the deep soft snow that had remained well protected from the sun and wind.

At the top we gather ourselves as we take in the view.

We checked the topo maps and it didn't look too bad directly down so we cautiously worked our way down to the snow line.

After a short decent, we traverse skiers left to an open bowl area and see fresh tracks from the day.

The ski out wasn't terrible, made it all the way to the hairpin in one push.
