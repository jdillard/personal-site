We arrived in Chamonix and having just missed several days of stormy weather, which included 150km winds through the valley floor. The storm finally slowed the night before we were to do La Vallee Blanche, bringing cold snow up high along with calmer winds setting up what could be the perfect powder conditions.

Since it was our first time in Chamonix, we decided to hire a guide, Pierre, through [Compagnie des guides de Chamonix](www.chamonix-guides.com) who called us the day before to line things up. At one point he asked if we had powder skis, and judging from his tone he partly did it to make sure we were prepared for the conditions, but mostly hinting he was hoping we were on the same page about getting after it the next day.

Pierre's persistence continues to pay off as we stay towards the front of the pack, sometimes even taking the lead. Due to all the recent snow, we navigate the glacier field with ease before finally reaching the flat section past the toe of the glacier. The perfeect location for a quick lunch.

At one point Pierre asks if we have wives or girlfriends and we say no, not sure where this is going. Then follows with grin by saying _"Sometimes when you get this lucky with the snow you have to wonder if your partner is getting lucky back home as well"_.

While waiting for the train, the guides talked amongst themselves how it was one of the best days of the season, and even up on the list for other seasons. The reward for taking the risk that morning had paid off.
