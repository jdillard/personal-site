The morning started with our traditional stop at [Whitaker
Cafe](https://whittakersbunkhouse.com/cafe/) to grab some coffee and ambience.
This time the parking lot was bustling, it must have been the first weekend of
their guiding season. Given the large crowd, we moved quickly to try and get a
spot near the front of the line at the gate.

The snow from the previous storm had settled and the week leading up had
contributed small amounts of consistant snow with cold temps and fairly low
winds. A sunny window was forecasted for most the day, and since the gate was
still opening at 9AM, we knew we had to move fast.

The avalanche forecast was potential for wet loose, so we had some concearns
about the chute, given it was so large, as well as the steep walls on either
side of the valley exit. Every time we told someone we were doing the chute,
they responded that you want to do it good condiitons. The reasons for that
became more apparent throughout the day.

## The Approach

We started the approach at around 9:20am and boy was it was hot down low, I
always seem to underestimate the power of the sun. We sped our way up, feeling
the pressure of the congo line behind us. Along the way, we talked to an older
gentleman for a bit that looked like he frequented the area, and it was great
to get some insights and share goals for the day.

Given the the power of the sun and the head start it got on us this morning, we
split off from the main crowd early and decided to only go up as far as we
needed to drop into the chute so the snow didn't bake anymore than it already
had.

Once we neared the transition spot we picked out at top of rock outcrop, the
clouds rolled in over the Nisqually River valley. By the time we finished
transitioning, five people ended up beating us to the chute. Michael dropped in
first, and I made sure to get a video of him going down, which seemed to last
forever, but in reality was around a minute long. The shear size of the chute
starts to sink in.

He gets skiiers right over the lip at the bottom of the run and signals that he
is in an island of safety. I start making my turns, and the chute feels like a
big open bowl it is so wide. By the time I reach the end my legs dead, I
definitley need to work on my ski stamina.

The snow in the chute was great, but as soon as I met up with Michael in the
island of safety it started to get soft, warm, and grabby. We decide to finish
the bridge run, versus skin up and out, and made some miserable turns down to
the next section.

The snow got better for the next set of turns, we weren't sure if it was
reverse corn from the cloud cover, or had just been more protected from the sun.

From there we followed the tracks that were in ahead of use to the right into more
grabby snow, trying to keep speed, but ultimately having to do the awkward ski
stepping up the hill so we could build up enough gravity to side hill out.

Skiing along the creek on the way out was beautiful. We reached the bridge
around 1:00PM and took some obligatory bridge pics, then finished the day at
Rainier BaseCamp Bar & Grill for burgers and beer.
