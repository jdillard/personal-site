Stop at Whitaker's Bunkhouse per usual and it was packed, must have been the first weekend of their season.

Consistant snow, snow from storm had settled, should be sunny for most the day. Gate still opened at 9am.

Potential for wet loose, chute and exit a concern.

## The Approach

Start around 9:20am and it was hot AF. Sped our way up. Talked to an older guy for a bit.

Clouds role in. Transition at top of rock outcrop.

5 people beat us to the chute. He drops in first. Takes for ever to get down.

My turn, takes forever, big open bowl, legs dead. Snow good, but gets soft warm and grabby.

Snow gets better, not sure if it was reverse corn from the cloud cover, or just more protected.

Ski along creek. Reach bridge around 1:00PM.
