Washington Pass opened later than usual this year, due to the never ending
winter, but there luckily was a weather window the Friday after it opened so we
jumped on it.

I slept in Mazama at the [Goat Creek
Sno-Park](https://goo.gl/maps/1fcmUByfYYyAq2uY6) and Michael stopped before the
pass to sleep since he had to come up from Seattle after work. On his way to
meet me at the amazing [Mazama Store](https://www.themazamastore.com/) he
noticed there wasn't much parking dug out this year and most of it was already
full.

We quickly grabbed our coffee and breakfast and headed out to park and shuttle
cars before all the good spots were taken.

## The Approach

We started at the Blue Lake Trailhead, skinning up and out of the trees,
getting a closer look at the Liberty Bell group for the first time as a light
dusting of snow fell.

This being my first time at the pass, the views of the Liberty Bell Group were
absolutely stunning, and I was incredibly grateful these were the conditions
under which I got to experience them.

Everything was covered in a healthy amount of snow still, giving that true
winter wonderland feel. I couldn't imagine having access to this zone in the
Winter.

We stopped for a second below the cornice push for a quick snack and to analyze
the situation. Given the Winter like conditions, we followed the established
skin track up.

Some others opted to take the safer boot pack up the lookers left. I decided to
try out my new pair of Petzl Leopards out for the final boot pack and they
worked like a charm.

A large group of us transitioned while soaking in the views, before dropping
down on Madison Avenue. Chunder from a previous heat spell days before met with
the low temps in the teens the night before and made for not the best snow, but
it was still possible to sniff out some good lines with less chunder.

We chatted with some people that lived in Mazama and ended up following them to
an alternate saddle that was left of Copper col.

On the way we saw two guys going for the couloir over Copper Pass, inspiration
for next season.

![Looking out from the saddle below Pica Peak](/assets/images/trips/birthday-tour-second-col.jpg "Looking out from the saddle below Pica Peak"){: .shadow-5.oversized}{: loading="lazy"} <small><i>Looking at [Big Kangaroo](/trips/big-kangaroo-ski-tour) from the saddle below Pica Peak.</i></small>

The views of Kangaroo and Wallaby from the top of the saddle were amazing,
providing an excellent view of future missions.

After some discussion on the best entry method, we dropped into the icy
conditions up top, but again sniffed out more good snow down lower. The final
run out with the hairpin in the background was dreamy to say the least.

Once we hit the road we started the long walk to back to the truck, Walking up
on the snow bank to get out of the road and right when it started to get worse
I hear an engine slowing down behind me, knowing it can only mean one thing. I
turned around to a loan skier in a first gen Tacoma offering us a ride, a
PNW dream come true. We summarized the conditions we experienced the best we
could as some sort of compensation for the ride.

After we switched back into some comfortable clothes, we went into Winthrop
for a big meal with a bucolic backdrop. A perfect end to the tour.
