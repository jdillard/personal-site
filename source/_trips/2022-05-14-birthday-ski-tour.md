Transition while soaking in the views. Frozen chunder from previous heat
meeting low temps in the teens the night before. Sniffed out some good snow.

Chatted with some people living in Mazama and ended up following them to an
alternative col left of Copper col.

Saw two guys going for the coilior over Copper Pass.

Views of Kangaroo and Wallaby from the top of the col were amazing.

Discussed the entry and how chundery it looked. Watched/listened to them go
down.

Icy up top but sniffed out good snow down low. Run out with the hairpin in the
background.

Fun skiing back down to the road, the snow starting to get a little soft and
grabby.

Start the long walk to back to the truck when a first gen tacoma stops and
offers a ride. Walking up on the snow bank to get out of the road and it slowly
starts to get worse as a hear an engine slowing down behind me, knowing it can
only mean one thing.

Go into Winthrop for a big meal with a bucolic backdrop.
