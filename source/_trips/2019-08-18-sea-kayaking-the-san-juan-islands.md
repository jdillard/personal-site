In an attempt to mix things up, some friends and I decided to go on our first
sea kayaking adventure in the Salish Sea. We had all done our fair share of
other adventures before, but this was brand new territory and a chance to test
our abilities with the unknown.

## Itinerary

Our original plan was a 3 day trip that started on Lopez Island, used [Jones
Island State Park](https://parks.state.wa.us/525/Jones-Island) as a base camp,
and ended back on Lopez Island.

For reasons I'll cover later, we ended up using [Turn Island Marine State Park](https://parks.state.wa.us/295/Turn-Island)
as a base camp instead. Even though we didn't stick to the planned itinerary it
still ended up being a lot of fun and, more importantly, a great learning opportunity.

## Day 1 - Arrive at Lopez Island

We reserved the **9:35 AM** [ferry from Anacortes to Lopez Island](https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Ferries/Schedule/ScheduleDetail.aspx?departingterm=1&arrivingterm=13&roundtrip=true), because [Lopez Kayaks](https://www.lopezkayaks.com)
didn't open until **9:00 AM** and we thought that would still allow us to time
the tides correctly. In hindsight, catching the **6:15 AM** ferry and using that
extra time to unload the gear and have it prepped would have given us the margin
of error we would need.

On the ferry that morning there was a thick fog with minimal visibility,
something we wouldn't have been able to paddle in and something we didn't plan
for. Luckily, it cleared up by the time we arrived on Lopez Island, but had it
happened on the water and forced us to time the tides differently, it would have
been a different story.

Since there were three of us, we decided to do one double touring kayak and one
single, with a total of five dry bags between us. We had received advice that we
wouldn't need a full wet suit, but according to [the 120&deg; Rule](https://www.gobair.org/Resources/Documents/Cold_Water.pdf)
and the conditions we encountered wearing at least a farmer john would have put
us in a more appropriate safety margin. Dry suits would have obviously been
ideal.

> tells many tales of strong kayakers that have died in those waters.

We finally got the kayaks all geared up and hit the water at **12:00 PM**, a bit
later than we planned, while the tides stuck to their schedule. Everything was
going pretty smooth as we crossed the exposed and windy San Juan Channel, until
we neared the Turn Rock Light where we misjudged our approach in the strong
tides, causing us to almost get swept North East back out into the middle of the
channel where it takes a 90 degree turn.
 
In what seemed like an eternity of fighting the tides and the wind, we finally
made it over to shore to gather ourselves. It turns out there is a small island
that shows up at low tide that Turn Rock Light sits on just off of Turn Island
that funnels the tide and causes the currents to be quite a bit faster. Another
dose of reality, having learned the hard way the limits of the tide charts we
had read online.

We headed off again towards our destination, but shortly after a member of our
party started experiencing vertigo, so we pulled back over on land to take a
longer rest and discuss our options. We decided on heading back, but to look for
camping opportunities along the way just in case.

Luckily for us, we came across a mostly empty Turn Island Marine State Park and
were able to pick a prime camping spot right on the bay. We made sure to hang up
our food as we heard there is a ruthless gang of racoons on the island, who once
chewed through the hull of a kayak to get to some stowed food. We walked around
and saw starfish crawling on the rocks and later that night we were lucky enough
to be able to hear whales breaching off in the distance as they migrated down
the channel.

## Day 2 - Checking out Friday Harbor

Since we had planned on having running water available at our original campsite,
and Turn Island didn't provide that, we had to make a trek into Friday Harbor
the next day. We decided to wait until lunch time so we could grab a bite to eat
and try to hit the slack tide, but not so late that it was high tide while we 
were there and our potential landing areas would be underwater.

The closer to Friday Harbor we got the more overwhelming it was due to the
scattered boats of all sizes, ferries coming to and from the harbor, and
sea planes landing and taking off with tourists. We carefully made it into to
dock and were able to enjoy some fresh coffee and food before doing some
shopping for beer, cheese, and sausage -- oh, and water.

We got back to camp where we were greeted by a large group of kayakers that
turned out to be members of the Washington Kayak Club. They could tell we were
beginners and gave us a bunch of helpful sea kayaking tips that made us more
confident going forward.

Once night hit, one of the kayakers came over to tell us that if we were lucky
we might get a chance to see the bioluminescence in the bay. Sure enough, it
finally got dark enough and it turned out to be an incredible experience as we
splashed the water to activate the chemical reaction and sped our kayaks up and
down the shoreline as small glowing bow waves formed off the front of the kayak
like a scene from Tron.

## Day 3 - Return to Lopez Island

We woke up early to pack so that we could catch the slack tide back, which
worked out perfectly. Crossing the San Juan Channel when everything was
completely still and not a boat in sight was a totally different experience.
We saw dolphins in the distance and even had some curious seals cruising around
our kayaks and poking there little bald heads up to keep an eye on us.

After returning the kayaks, we did some hiking and got in line early for the
ferry back, since there are only so many spots available on the return ride and
we were told it can get pretty backed up on the weekends.
