Washington received an atmospheric river in late October that stretched all the way to Washington Pass, where it turned to a healthy dose of snow. Since there wasn't much of a base, there wasn't much avalanche danger and the pass stayed open. And any time the pass is open and there is skiing, I prefer to be out there.

I had wanted to explore that area in winter, especially after climbing the [South Buttress](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/109326651/south-buttress) that summer, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity to ski a safe line and do some exploring. Since avalanche forecasts weren't being performed yet, we wanted to play it conservative.

People at Rainy pass. Not the earliest start, but the first ones.

## The Approach

We basically followed the direct summer trail, there were some tracks from what looked like the day before, but not many.

We were able to follow a faint skin track most of the way to above treeline, before the wind had swept it away.

- Low coverage, but still full coverage down low. Creek crossing was easy
- Unconsolidated snow, so easy to uncover rocks

## The Descent

- Dropped down the shoulder with decent snow
- Starting to warm up
- Go back the way we came (vs off the other side)
- Pick our way through the rocks (worst part)
- Getting warm, resting legs before last push

## Post ski

- Nothing was open, pizza place shut down early
- Ran into other skiiers and talked stories
