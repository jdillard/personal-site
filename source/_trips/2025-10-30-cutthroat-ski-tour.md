## Approach

- Took the direcet summer trail basically
- Some tracks, but not many
- Able to follow a faint skin track
- Low coverage, but still full coverage down low. Creek crossing was easy
- Unconsolidated snow, so easy to uncover rocks

## Descent

- Dropped down the shoulder with decent snow
- Starting to warm up
- Go back the way we came (vs off the other side)
- Pick our way through the rocks (worst part)
- Getting warm, resting legs before last push
