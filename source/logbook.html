      <strong>"The Route Pyramid"</strong>, is a visual representation of an
      approach to progression that emphasizes building a base of routes that are
      below the climber's maximum ability. This approach, and how to perfect it,
      is presented in the popular book <a class="no-underline i light-red"

      Climbers Training Manual</a>.

      <p class="pa3"><strong>Note:</strong> Unfortunatly, onX has <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/120168991/mountain-project-data-api-deprecated">deprecated the data API</a>
      so this tool is no longer functional. I recommend using <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/">thecrag.com</a>
      instead, as they have a built in <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/climber/leecujes">route pyramids</a>
      and their user content is <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/terms#licensing-of-ip-user-content">creative commons</a>.
      They even have an <a href="https://www.thecrag.com/en/article/importlogbook">import tool</a>
      if you want to migrate your ticks over.</p>
