## Contributing

Feel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/jdillard/personal-site/pulls)
or [open an issue](https://github.com/jdillard/personal-site/issues) for any
problems that you run into or corrections that you think need to be made.

If you are editing css/js files you need to run `npm start` (in addition to
`rake serve` -- so two different terminal windows) to get the live preview.

Once you are done editing, you need to build the poduction version of the
distribution files using `npm run build`. It is best to commit any updates to
the built distribution files as their own commit with the commit message `update
built assets`.
